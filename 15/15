Had some issues on this one, ended up getting on the irc and has for some help.
Basically had to brute force the password with a blind SQLi, the issue was that I used 'like'
which isn't case sensitive. I worked that out by talking to an admin over irc. To fix I used 
'like binary' makingthe query case sensitive.

Script is in folder.
