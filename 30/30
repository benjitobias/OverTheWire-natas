In the source code you can see that the query is escaped using quote(param('password')).
The problem here is that param receives the password variable as is it given. The param function, if given multiple paramaters with the same name ie. password=test&password=test2 will group them as an array.
What quote then receives is an array. If quote receives an array, the second variable defines the data type and how to escape. If the data type provided refers to a numeric type, no escaping is done and that allows for an SQLi.
