I tried a few thingsafter looking at the source code.
At dirst I tried using '<censored>' as the xor key - didn't work.
Then, after noticing that the script to wechallinfo also used '<censored>' I thought that maybe the xor key was the password to this level - didn't work.

I then realised that the cookie would have to be json and would most likely be the same order as $defaultdata - Worked

Python decode and encode script in folder.
