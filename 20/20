(If I understand correctly)

When reading the session files, the script splits the file by '\n' and then iterated over each line.
It then splits each line by " " and if something exists on both sides of the space ("key value") it then adds them to the $_SESSION array as key value.
If the the $_SESSION array has an "admin" key that contains "1" it will print the password.
What we need to do is first create a session and "inject" the 'admin 1' into the file and then reload the page with the same session (same name) and the password is given.
