So the code uses unserialize which immediately caught my attention.
After reading a bit here: https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/untrusted-data-unserialize-php/
I understood that I need to create a malicious object.
The code unserializes the cookie after decoding it from base64.
So, create a malicious object based on the source code of the site using the Logger object and then send it, serialized and encoded as a cookie.
