If I change something in the URL query I get "Incorrect amount of PKCS#7 padding for blocksize" which means there is a problem with the encryption padding.
There is an attack called "The Padding Oracle Attack" that can give me some direction.
I'll look into it at some point.

Fucking complicated. It's not a Padding Oracle Attack. I had to read a lot and eventually found a video with the solution (which I barely understood).

After watching the video, I'm going to try and solve it again in order to fully understand.

FUUUUUUCK. Watch video and read code written to understand solution.
