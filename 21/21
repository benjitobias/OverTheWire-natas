In natas21-experimenter if "submit=1" is set in the request, any key/value is added to the $_SESSION variable.
Since natas21-experimenter and natas21 are on the same site, if we take the PHPSESSID cookie from natas21 and add to the keys in natas21-experimenter admin=1 and change the cookie to the natas21 cookie, admin=1 will be added to $_SESSION browse to natas21 and voila.
