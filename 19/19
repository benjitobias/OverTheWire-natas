Actually had to google to understand how to generate a new cookie *facepalm*.
I forgot that I had to login, and then reload the page.

Looking at the cookie, and a bit of python I realied that the cookie was basically a randomly generated number (it seems up to 1000) and then a "-" and the the username, reverse (or something like that, it's in the python script).

Then we brute force cookies :)
